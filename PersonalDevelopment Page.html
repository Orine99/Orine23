												<h4>Well-Organized</h4>
												<p>
												One of my greatest strength at work that i have recognized 
												would have to be my ability to be a well-organized individual.
												I tend to write what i have to do on paper and prioritize
												what is more important to least important .In doing this, it
												helps me organize and accomplish my work and meet deadlines that are 
												important.
												</P>
												<h4>Team-Work</h4>
												<P>
												Another important strength I have learnt is teamwork.Although
												most of the time it is hard to work with other people , I make it my 
												duty to focus on not only my goals but also my teamates goal as well.
												As I keep progressing and learning this skill it as help my to be more of
												of a listener more than a speaker,give all my teamates a chance to share all
												their input then we all work toward a shared goal.
												</P>
												<h4>Solving-Problems</h4>
												<p>
												Finally, I am a solution-oriented person and quick learner. As a computer
												science student, I learned to perform well under pressure when designing and
												implementing  my programs. I am always thinking of the best possible and 
												efficient way to solve a problem.

												<p>
												As a student on upcoming software developer,reading the twelve pillar has 
												affected the way I think and view life. Mr. Charlie a old wise man ,while passing
												on some valuable life lesson to Micheal his apprentice, I have learn that setting goals
												and writing them down can meaningfully change the way my mind organize what is more important
												pursue in my life.Charlie quoted,"writting down your goal". This very power has it brings my
												goals in to reality, so I can start working towards acheive them which will also change my attitude
												in acheive something extradinary in my life.
												<br/>
												Another, key lesson I have learnt is that I must set time for what matter most in my life.
												I must value every second of  every day that God has granted me and work towards  self development.
												Also,I must strive to surround with valuable people , that can have a huge impact on my life and career.
												It may be easy at times to be distracted by my present surrouding but, if I wnat to be successful I must
												must surround myself with successfull people.Finally,reading a book is important and I must push myself 
												to read and gain knowledge about how things work around me. When i dedicate myself reading,I will be able
												to explore different worlds from the comfort of my home.Books,are filled with a lot of knowledge and wisdom 
												that can teach me new things that will ultimately change the course of my life.
